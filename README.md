# Flash Loan Protocol — Borrow and repay loans within one transaction

## Project Description
This smart contract protocol allows users to borrow tokens instantly and repay them within the same transaction — a technique known as a flash loan. The borrower receives tokens, performs arbitrary logic, and repays the loan before the transaction ends, enabling zero-collateral loans.

## Project Vision
To enable decentralized finance (DeFi) users and developers to leverage instant liquidity without upfront capital, unlocking innovative financial use cases such as arbitrage, collateral swapping, and self-liquidation.

## Key Features
- Instant token borrowing and repayment within one transaction.
- Callback interface for borrowers to implement custom logic.
- Ensures loans are repaid before transaction completion.
- Compatible with any ERC-20 token.

## Future Scope
- Add fees to flash loans for protocol sustainability.
- Support multiple token types and flash loans in batch.
- Integrate with decentralized oracles for better security.
- Extend borrower interface to support more complex workflows.
- Deploy multisig governance for protocol upgrades and controls.
